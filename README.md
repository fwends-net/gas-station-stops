## 🪫 🚴‍♀️ The Problem

Cyclists run out of steam. On longer rides, you're spending more energy than you can carry food and drink in your pockets or in your bottles.

## The Solution

For decades, cyclists have used this simple life hack to solve this problem:

**Gas station convenience stores.**

They offer everything a bonking cyclist could dream of: Sugary, salty treats in all types, forms and shapes.

## The Problem, Reloaded

This immediately leads to the problem of finding said gas stations, which is a practical application of all galactic civilisations phases, as phrased by Douglas Adams:

_“The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question 'How can we eat?' the second by the question 'Why do we eat?' and the third by the question 'Where shall we have lunch?”_

_[Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/71510-the-history-of-every-major-galactic-civilization-tends-to-pass)_

Trying to find a gas station while out riding is possible, but potentially frustrating. Also, as we all know, whenever you need a gas station because you bonked, there's none to be found in a 10km radius. And there's nothing more infuriating than a gas station 5k from the end of your ride when the man with the hammer visited 30 minutes ago.

## The Solution, for Real

Plan your ride around gas stations at the right locations. With the Gas Station Planner, you upload your GPX file and get a list of gas stations that are on the route or reachable via a small detour. Pick your favorite and mark it on your ride, or replan the route to pass the station.

## Creation

This tool was vibe coded in 10 minutes and is yet another example of the capabilities of AI coding assistants.
The human part of this creation was the expression of a need and interest: I simply said Claude Code that I wanted a tool that gave me all gas stations along a planned route.
After it built a Python script that did exactly that, I understood that it was possible, and asked it to build an interactive web tool for it.
